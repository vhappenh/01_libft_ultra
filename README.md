# libft_ultra

"Libft" is a C programming project where students create their own library containing essential functions commonly used in programming. 
The project involves implementing standard C library functions and additional custom functions, following specific technical considerations and guidelines. 
Students must adhere to coding standards, proper memory management, and provide a Makefile for compilation. Bonus functions can be included separately.
The completed project is submitted to a designated git repository for grading, serving as a fundamental exercise in C programming and library creation.
